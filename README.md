# Corn√©'s Dotfiles

I've copied a lot from [mathias's](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/) and [paul's](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles) dotfiles.

## Installation
Git clone this in a folder where you can keep the files, for example `~/dotfiles`, enter that directory and run `setup.sh`. It will than symlink the dotfiles and z from [rupa](https://github.com/rupa/z).

For some aliases/functions you need to have some stuff installed.

* for `server` you need to have screen installed and NodeJS http-server `npm install http-server -g`
* for `c` you need Pygments; `pip install pygments`

Also make sure you change the default username in .exports

The most easy way to install is: `git clone https://github.com/cornedor/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./setup.sh`

## .extra
The .extra file has some private configs which are not part of this repo.
